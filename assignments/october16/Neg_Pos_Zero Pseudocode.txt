Stage 1

1. Obtain 5 integers
2. Determine the nature of the number (positive, negative or 0)
3. Display how many are positive, negative, and 0

Stage 2

1. Recognise value 0
2. Store as negCounter
3. Recognise value 0
4. Store as posCounter
5. Recognise value 0
6. Store as zeroCounter
7. Recognise value 1
8. Store as numCounter
9. While  numCounter <= 5, prompt user to enter a number
10. If number is less than zero, increment negCounter by 1
11. Else if number == 0, increment zeroCounter by 1
12. Else, increment posCounter by 1
13. Display posCounter
14. Display negCounter
15. Display zeroCounter
